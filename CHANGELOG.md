# Changelog

All changes to this project **and to the Pi** are recorded here, newest first.
Details for each day: `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Pi configuration changes: `docs/pi-state.md`.

## 2026-10-21

### Added
- `docs/design.md`: design for pinfer (Qwen engine + split-core Linux, level 2).
- `harness/pi.py`: `check`, `push`, `run`, `bench`, `snapshot`; `harness/runlog.py`: automatic
  audit log (`logs/harness.jsonl`), full `run` output in `logs/runs/`.
- `bench/memband/memband.c` + `Makefile`: DRAM bandwidth benchmark (static aarch64 build).
- `os/stock/render_firstboot.py`, `os/stock/flash_disk.ps1`, `os/stock/compare_disk.ps1`:
  headless first-boot config, verified raw flashing, block comparison.
- `docs/pi-state.md`, `docs/journal/`, this changelog, project `CLAUDE.md` logging rules.

### Pi
- Flashed Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit 2026-10-06 (trixie) to the Crucial X6 SSD (old
  install erased with user approval). First boot 21:03:53 KST.
- Change #1: Wi-Fi power save disabled.
- Change #2: eth0 static 10.42.0.2/24 for a direct PC↔Pi cable; harness now uses it
  (Wi-Fi drops every few minutes with reason=7 — kept only for the Pi's internet).
- PC change P1: Windows Ethernet static 10.42.0.1/24 (`os/pc/eth_link.ps1`, has `-Undo`).

### Measured
- memband: 4.20 / 4.08 / 4.07 GB/s with 1 / 2 / 4 threads (`bench/results/memband_20261021_210615.json`).

### Fixed
- Harness: pushed files lacked the exec bit; unknown throttle state counted as valid;
  stderr not saved; `run` with `;` could run outside the work dir.
- memband: threads not pinned to CPUs; slice alignment for odd thread counts.
